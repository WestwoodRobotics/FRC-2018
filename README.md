# FRC-2018

This code was used to run the robot, the driverstation dashboard, and the arcade cabinet that was used for the 2018 FRC season: _Power Up_.

## The Robot Code

The code for the robot itself was written in Java this year and uses the wpilib libraries for the majority of the API. The main subsystems of the robot this year included the main arm, which rotated about a central fulcrum, a claw, which consisted of a pneumatic-powered actuating system that would grip the power cubes and intake wheels to act as auxillary function, and the drivetrain, which was used to move the robot around on the field. The robot would move around for the first 15 seconds of the copmetition autonomously, followed by a period of operator-controller action.

## The Driver Station

In order to control the robot effectively, the driverstation's dashboard was modified to match our team's needs. The modifications were done in LabView, building upon the default dashboard.

## The Arcade

As a side project, our team created a retro video-game arcade station using a Raspberry Pi (see _RetroPi_). Our team made modifications to the sprites and sounds of the classic Super Mario Bros. video game.
